Breve explanation of the current project.
I've got to try and recreate the google homepage with my knowledge of css and html5
nothing functional but just the most frontest of ends to look like google

when finishing this I should have an idea of how to use basic functions from css and html5, and a basic idea of using the developer mode of chrome for my advantage

also maybe more important to start learning about how to use git and get used to adding and commiting things, 

well that's it, i wish myself luck.
